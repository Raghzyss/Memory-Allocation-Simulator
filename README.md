# 🧠 Memory Allocation Simulator (Frontend Only - OS Mini Project)

A simple and interactive **Memory Allocation Simulator** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project demonstrates classic **memory management algorithms** used by Operating Systems:

- **First Fit**
- **Best Fit**
- **Worst Fit**

The simulation runs **entirely in the browser** — *no backend required*.  
Just open `index.html` and you're ready to go!
